**Guidelines for Enhancement:**

1. **Consistency**: Ensure that fonts, bullet points, and spacing are consistent throughout the document.
2. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Use clear, concise language and avoid jargon unless it is industry-specific and widely understood.
3. **Quantify Achievements**: Whenever possible, use numbers to quantify your achievements (e.g., increased sales by 20%).
4. **Action Verbs**: Start bullet points with strong action verbs like "Developed," "Led," "Implemented," etc.
5. **Tailor for the Job**: Customize the CV for each job application by emphasizing the most relevant experience and skills.

If you have the text of the CV, feel free to share it, and I can provide more specific enhancements.
